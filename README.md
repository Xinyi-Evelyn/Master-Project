Pipeline:
1. Measuring the composition of TIME in each sample

2. The visualization of immune cells in the tumor tissue

3. The abundance of each type of immune cell

4. Measuring the distance between tumor cells and each type of immune cell
4.1  The distance between tumor cells and each T-cell subset
4.2  The distance between tumor cells and each type of innate immune cells
4.3  The analysis of clusters composed of T-cell subsets
4.4  The distance between tumor cells and clustering and non-clustering T cells
4.5  The distance between APCs and clustering T cells
  
5. The analysis of each cell density in all of samples of HGGs and LGGs
5.1  The density distribution of each type of immune cells in HGGs and LGGs...40
5.2  Wilcoxon test to detect the significance of densities in two groups
5.3  The densities heatmap
5.4  The cluster analysis of T-cell subsets in each sample
5.5  The number of cluster analysis of T-cell subsets in each case
5.6  The compositions of clusters in each sample
